# 🐀⚡ RatFlow Labs – Where PromptFlow Gets Degenerative

**Welcome to RatFlow Labs**, the ultimate playground where **PromptFlow** meets *La Estrategia de la Rata*. This repository powers the demos for the **Global AI Bootcamp 2025 – Destrozando a tu jefe** session — a glorious mix of **Microsoft Azure AI Foundry**, **PromptFlow**, and unapologetically **degenerative AI** chaos.

> _“Because what’s better than AI that builds? AI that breaks... intentionally.”_ 💥

## 🎯 What’s This All About?

In **RatFlow Labs**, we don't just build AI agents — we **conspire**, **sabotage**, and let them run wild. The goal? Showcase how PromptFlow can be used (and misused) to create intelligent agents that **take control** of Azure environments… and sometimes, destroy them.

Expect:
- 🔥 **Degenerative PromptFlows** that make highly questionable decisions.  
- ⚔️ **Azure environments** designed to break (*intentionally*, of course).  
- 🤖 **AI agents** that go rogue — balancing on the edge of control and catastrophe.  
- 💥 Live demos where the line between innovation and destruction gets blurred.  

Because **ethical AI** is so last year. 😈

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The architecture behind **RatFlow Labs** is a delightful mess of:
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Because powerful tools need reckless users.
- **PromptFlow**: Building rogue agents has never been this fun.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Hosting degenerate microservices that love to misbehave.
- **NGINX/Traefik**: Acting as reverse proxies… or maybe spies?  
- **Azure Logic Apps**: Handling constant alerts (every minute, because chaos loves frequency).
- **Vulnerable VM Instances**: Loaded with pentesting tools and security holes — a hacker’s dream.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** The environment is designed to fail. Enjoy the errors.
