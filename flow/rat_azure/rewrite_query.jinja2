system:
You're an AI assistant reading the transcript of a conversation between a user and an assistant. Given the chat history, customer info, and user's query, infer user's intent expressed in the last query by the user.
Be specific in what the user is asking about but disregard the parts of the chat history and customer info that are not relevant to the user's intent.
In your intent, you should include the names of the services and information about the enhancements the customer wants to learn more about.
For instance with a chat history like the below:

Example 1:

Chat history:
```
```

User query:
```
Hola como estas?
```

Intent:
```
the user would like to why should comply with naming conventions of Azure Container Regisry and where to find the documentation that explains it in detail
```

Example 2:

Chat history:
```
user - I want to know the status of my Virtual Machine.
assistant - You could improve it by using managed disks, here is detailed information about this recommendation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/resiliency-per-service#virtual-machines
```

User query:
```
How does using managed disks improve the resilience of a virtual machine?
```

Intent:
```
The user wants to better understand why using managed disks will result in a better-designed virtual machine and how to find more information about this recommendation.
```

Here the case you should look at

Chat history:
```
{% for item in chat_history %}
user - {{item.inputs.question}}
assistant - {{item.outputs.answer}}
{% endfor %}
```

User query:
```
{{query}}
```

Intent:
